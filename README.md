This script adds the Mozilla APT repo, pins it so their version of Firefox is preferred, and installs Firefox.

The script follows this word-for-word: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions-recommended

Tested on Debian 13 (trixie).
